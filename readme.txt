Enjoy the Shakespearean responses: Embrace the language and style of Shakespeare's era. Appreciate the poetic and dramatic responses provided by the chatbot, and immerse yourself in the world of Shakespeare.

Ask for internet browsing: Use the keyword "browse" followed by a query to request the chatbot to browse the internet and retrieve relevant information. The chatbot will attempt to provide a Shakespearean summary of the findings.

Explore mathematical queries: Use the keyword "math" followed by a mathematical expression or a specific calculation like factorial to test the chatbot's mathematical abilities. It will respond with a Shakespearean interpretation of the result.
